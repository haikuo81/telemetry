# Telemetry [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yammer/telemetry.png)](https://travis-ci.org/yammer/telemetry)

Make your app talk…and talk…and talk. Inspired by Google's [Dapper](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html).

Here is a sample trace view generated by the
[TracingBundle](telemetry-dropwizard/src/main/java/com/yammer/telemetry/dropwizard/TracingBundle.java) of the
execution of the [TracedResource](telemetry-example/src/main/java/com/yammer/telemetry/example/resources/TracedResource.java) in the telemetry-example application.

![Sample Span](/telemetry-service/screenshot.png "Sample Span View")

## IDs

Trace and span IDs will be expressed as 64-bit and 32-bit longs respectively.

## Trace/Span Passing

In order to trace across hosts trace ID and span ID information must be passed from one host to the next.

### Over HTTP

Clients will pass the current trace ID and the current span ID to downstream services via HTTP request headers:

    X-Telemetry-TraceId: {current trace ID}
    X-Telemetry-SpanId: {current span ID}
    X-Telemetry-Parent-SpanId: {parent span ID, may be absent if this is the root span}

## Notes

   * Under heavy development - stuff **will** change
   * Telemetry-Service has been deprecated for now to concentrate on instrumentation and trace recording
